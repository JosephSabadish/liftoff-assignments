## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a survey that lets people provide information
about themselves. The survey will have portions that are required
and portions the user can answer if he or she wants to. After all
required information is entered, the user will be directed to a
results page where he/she'll be thanked and can see the stats of
others who have taken the survey. Users will find the survey
useful because they can easily provide information. The idea for the project 
came from a suggestion provided by another student.

### Features
'Enter information': Users can enter various information about themselves as part
of a survey. Some of the information will be optional for the user to enter.

'Submit': The user will be able to submit the information provided and see how the
data they provided is related to the overall survey.

else with them who wants to take the survey.
